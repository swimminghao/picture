## Usage

The two main keywords are `;o` & `;sa`:

- `;sa [<query>]` - Search all notebooks/section groups/sections

    - <kbd>↩︎</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>NUM</kbd> — Open selection in OneNote

- `;o [<query>]` — Browse OneNote notebooks in Alfred.
    - <kbd>↩︎</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>NUM</kbd> — View the selections sub-sections, if it has no sub-sections (deepest level of notebook) it will open the page in OneNote.
    - <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>↩︎</kbd> — Open selection in OneNote instead.

Base url is stored with `seturl`:

### Configuration

The workflow locates a plist file that contains the names of the notebooks, sections and pages, and then uses those to build a URL that OneNote can respond to. The base of the URL, however, is unique to each machine and cannot be found within the plist. So in order for this workflow to work
1. Open OneNote, right click a notebook, section, or page and click the `Copy Link to {Page/Notebook/Section}`.
2. Use the `seturl` keyword and paste the copied link and press <kbd>↩︎</kbd>. After the base url is stored, the workflow should be functional.
    - **_NOTE:_** If your notebook is stored on Microsoft Sharepoint, the URL that's created _cannot be opened locally_, the notebook must be stored in OneDrive for the URL to valid.
